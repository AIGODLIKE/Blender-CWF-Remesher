// PQP_REAL
//
// This is the floating point type used throughout PQP.  doubles are
// recommended, both for their precision and because the software has
// mainly been tested using them.  However, floats appear to be faster
// (by 60% on some machines).

//
// PQP_BV_TYPE
//
// PQP introduces a bounding volume (BV) type known as the "rectangle
// swept sphere" (RSS) - the volume created by sweeping a sphere so
// that its center visits every point on a rectangle; it looks
// something like a rounded box.
//
// In our experiments, the RSS type is comparable to the oriented
// bounding box (OBB) in terms of the number of BV-pair and triangle-pair
// tests incurred.  However, with our present implementations, overlap
// tests are cheaper for OBBs, while distance tests are cheaper for the
// RSS type (we used a public gjk implementation for the OBB distance test).
//
// Consequently, PQP is configured to use the RSS type in distance and
// tolerance queries (which use BV distance tests) and to use OBBs for
// collision queries (which use BV overlap tests). Using both requires six
// more PQP_REALs per BV node than using just one type.
//
// To save space, you can configure PQP to use only one type, however,
// with RSS alone, collision queries will typically be slower.  With OBB's
// alone, distance and tolerance queries are currently not supported, since
// we have not developed our own OBB distance test.  The three options are:
//
// #define PQP_BV_TYPE  RSS_TYPE
// #define PQP_BV_TYPE  OBB_TYPE
// #define PQP_BV_TYPE  RSS_TYPE | OBB_TYPE
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#define RSS_TYPE 1
#define OBB_TYPE 2

#define PQP_BV_TYPE RSS_TYPE | OBB_TYPE
