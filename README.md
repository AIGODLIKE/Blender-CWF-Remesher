## Introduction

This project is the implementation of [CWF](https://github.com/Xrvitd/CWF) paper in Blender.

## Features

路Directly remesh the selected mesh object.

路Set target sampling value

## Limitations

路CWF: Simply put, the algorithm focuses on maintaining a uniform distribution of vertices in the topology, rather than like QuadRemash or Instantmeshes, and the original code is relatively slow in running speed

路DEMO: The first version has only been initially implemented and has not been optimized for speed. The implementation of some parameters is still under development
